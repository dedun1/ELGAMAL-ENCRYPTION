Challenges Faced During Implementation And Findings:

1.Randomness in Encryption: Issue: Ensuring each encryption used a unique random value (k) to prevent patterns in the ciphertext.
   Solution: Generated a fresh random k for each character during encryption.
   
2- security depends on key size if the P is large it would be more secure but would increase computational time to process

3- randomness of k makes sure identical messages encrypt in different ciphertexts, makes the security stronger
